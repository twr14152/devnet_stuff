	- Comparing it to the exam blue print i think it covered sec(1.9)
   	- 1.9 Explain architectural patterns (monolithic, services oriented, microservices, and event 
driven)
	- Lightly covered Software Architecture and Design 
	- Functional/NonFunctional Requirements
   	- Micro Services Patterns
   	- Service Oriented Archectures
   	    - service registery
   	- Event driven (Pub/Sub, Event streaming)
   	- MVC
   	- There was alot of info on the SDLC that doesnt map to any one criteria on the BP
   	- Key topic are numerous in the chapter but again they dont quite map to anything on the BP
   	- Lots of info that may be relevant but not a lot that mapped back to anything
- Ch.2 

- Use CLN online Study Materials
