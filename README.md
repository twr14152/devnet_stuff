# Cisco Devnet Stuff

### Study Plan:
- Read DEVCOR OCG comparing to Exam Blue Print
- Tried this in 2022/2023 and was too boring had to stop..
- Round two 2024 - will post comments
- Ch.1
	- That chapter seems to simply be setting the stage for later ones.
	- Comparing it to the exam blue print i think it lightly touched on sec(1.9)
- Ch.2 
	- This chapter really started mapping to section 1.0 (1.1 - 1.9)
	- There was a lot of terminology and nested terminalogy at that.
	- Definitely can see potential for tricky questions	
	- Alot of the terminology gets used in networking but there more granularity here
	- The thought is the precision of their wording will provide more clarity to the non-functional requirements
