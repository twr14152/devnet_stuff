# Cisco Devnet Stuff

### Study Plan:
- Read DEVCOR OCG comparing to Exam Blue Print
- Tried this in 2022/2023 and was too boring had to stop..
- Round two 2024 - will post comments
- Ch.1
	- That chapter seems to simply be setting the stage for later ones.
	- Comparing it to the exam blue print i think it lightly touched on sec(1.9)
- Ch.2 
	- This chapter really started mapping to section 1.0 (1.1 - 1.9) of
	- There was a lot of terminology and nested terminalogy at that.
	- Definitely can see potential for tricky questions re. Quality Attributes in ISO/IEC 25010	
 	- Modularity (low coupling vs high cohesion, the effect of scope direct vs indirect adj, design goal small direct interfaces)
  	- HA and Resilency in application design (Horizontal and Verticle scaling)
  	- The pearson exam for that section was pretty easy
  	- Overall this chapter wasnt a bad read there's a lot of vocaulary but i think its necessary tool to really nail down non-functional requirements
  	- Definitely something I would review before taking the test. 
- Ch.3
	- This supposedly mapped to 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8 of exam blue print
 	- After reading this it seems like a light treatment of each section
  	- I think the keyword 'evaluate' in the topics may allow for the shallow coverage
  	- OOP SOLID principles were covered in this chapter and it seems it maybe considered foundational to these topics but it doesnt explicitly map to any one category
  	- These first three chapters will definitely require rereading.
  	- Because of the emphasis of some of the topics and the recommended reading throughout and at the end of the chapters wil probably investigate some of those references
