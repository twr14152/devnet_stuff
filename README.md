# Cisco Devnet Stuff

### Study Plan:
- Read DEVCOR OCG comparing to Exam Blue Print
- Tried this in 2022/2023 and was too boring had to stop..
- Round two 2024 - will post comments
- Ch.1
	- That chapter seems to simply be setting the stage for later ones.
	- Comparing it to the exam blue print i think it lightly touched on sec(1.9)
- Ch.2 
	- This chapter really started mapping to section 1.0 (1.1 - 1.9) of
	- There was a lot of terminology and nested terminalogy at that.
	- Definitely can see potential for tricky questions re. Quality Attributes in ISO/IEC 25010	
 	- Modularity (low coupling vs high cohesion)
  	- HA and Resilency in application design (Horizontal and Verticle scaling)
  	- The pearson exam for that section was pretty easy
  	- Overall this chapter wasnt a bad read there's a lot of vocaulary but i think its necessary tool to really nail down non-functional requirements
  	- Definitely something I would review before taking the test. 
- Ch.3
	-

- Use CLN online Study Materials
	- 2024 will provide comments as I go.
