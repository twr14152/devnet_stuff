### Study Plan:
- Read DEVCOR OCG
- Tried this in 2022/2023 and was too boring had to stop..
- Round two 2024 - will post comments

	- Comparing it to the exam blue print i think it covered sec(1.9)
   	- 1.9 Explain architectural patterns (monolithic, services oriented, microservices, and event 
driven)
	- Lightly covered Software Architecture and Design 
	- Functional/NonFunctional Requirements
   	- Micro Services Patterns 
        - Service Oriented Archectures
   	    - service registery
	- Event driven (Pub/Sub, Event streaming)
        - MVC
        - There was alot of info on the SDLC that doesnt map to any one criteria on the BP.
        - Key topic are numerous but again they dont quite map to anything so...
        - So I will get over it and move on.

- Use CLN online Study Materials
